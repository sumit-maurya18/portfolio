## 🛠️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get your portfolio up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sumit-maurya18/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create one for API keys). This project uses `nodemailer` and `resend`, so you might need API keys for your email service.

    Example `.env.local` (adjust as per your actual setup):
    ```
    # Resend API Key for contact form
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
    # Or Nodemailer configuration
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
    EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your portfolio.


## 🚀 Usage Examples

Once the development server is running, your portfolio will be accessible in your web browser.

### Viewing the Portfolio

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can interact with the different sections, view projects, and use the contact form.

### Project Structure Overview

The project is structured as a Next.js application:

```
portfolio/
├── .gitignore
├── .vscode/
├── app/                  # Main application pages and components
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── eslint.config.mjs     # ESLint configuration
├── jsconfig.json         # JavaScript configuration for VS Code
├── next.config.mjs       # Next.js configuration
├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
├── package-lock.json     # Locked dependency versions
├── postcss.config.mjs    # PostCSS configuration
└── README.md
```

### Sending Messages via Contact Form

Ensure your `.env.local` is correctly configured with your `RESEND_API_KEY` or `EMAIL_USER`/`EMAIL_PASS` details. Once configured, visitors to your portfolio can fill out the contact form, and messages will be sent to your specified email address.
